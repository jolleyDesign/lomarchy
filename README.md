# lomarchy

A (less) opinionated (and more FOSS centric) fork of DHH's Omarchy (Read more about Omarchy at [omarchy.org](https://omarchy.org))

## Installation


## Changes
I took DHH's Omarchy and made it more of a clean-slate starting point for Arch & Hyprland. 

For example, I removed a lot of the apps that were being installed by default (Zoom, 1Password, Dropbox, Xournal, etc), and changed some of the defaults & keybinds (Chromium => Firefox, Alacritty => Ghostty, BASH => ZSH, etc).
